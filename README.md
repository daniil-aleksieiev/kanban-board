### 🤔 Why WordPress?

Because we like to keep things… unexpected. WordPress provides a flexible backend using ACF to manage your tasks and statuses. Plus, it’s a great way to show that even WordPress can do some heavy lifting beyond blogs. 💪

### 🛠 How It Works

1. **Frontend:** Built with Next.js to provide a lightning-fast and seamless user experience.
2. **Backend:** WordPress and ACF manage tasks and statuses. All API calls are wrapped in JWT authorization to keep your data secure.
